This is a rewrite of the Deno website it will combine the code in
https://github.com/denoland/deno/tree/master/website
and https://github.com/denoland/registry and have faster deployment.

This is written in React / MaterialUI / Netlify. Not in Deno. Ideally this could be
ported to Deno at some point but we are in need of a new website and dogfooding
takes too long. We hope to see this code ported to Deno with minimal developer
flow interrupted (in particular, we need the ability to listen for FS events and
reload the web server).

## TODO

- [x] style guide
- [ ] benchmarks
- [ ] /x/
- [ ] plaintext code when curl /std/http/server.ts
